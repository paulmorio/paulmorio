### Hello there!

I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge (edit: thesis defended and looking for a job!). I work on deep learning with graph-structured data, mostly within biomedical contexts but also in many others! I like thinking about,and working with, complex and dynamic systems at various scales.

- I am currently doing things with multi-omics data, relational deep learning, and networks for work/research. For fun, I am currently studying generative modelling and multi-agent systems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on [PyRelational](https://github.com/RelationRx/pyrelational), a one-stop shop for constructing active learning pipelines.
  - PyRelationAL supports:
    - Construction of complex active learning pipelines
    - Development of novel acquisition functions / strategies / batching methods
    - Works with all your favourite ML frameworks and none as well
    - Interfacing with other AL packages

- I also work in a much less frequent manner on:
  - [Geo2DR](https://github.com/paulmorio/geo2dr): A library for learning distributed representations of graphs!
  - [Pytorch Geometric Temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal): A dynamic graph representation library!
